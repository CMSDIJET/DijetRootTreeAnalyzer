Introduction:
-------------

This package provides all the relevant scripts that are used to create reduced ntuples for the 
paired dijet analysis (narrow and wide resonance search, run3 processing), as well as perform 
various studies for the analysis (bias studies, data/MC comparisons, signal shapes, interpolation, 
trigger efficiency, run with screens or condor, noise filters, jet veto maps etc).

To run reduced ntuples setup in CMSSW_13_0_16 (or any CMSSW_13_X_Y). Most of the studies can be 
performed in this CMSSW as well.

However, to use Combine in order to perform fits, create datacards, calculate limits/significances etc
you will need to setup in CMSSW_10_2_13 (you can git clone the master branch instead of this one and
just copy the relevant config files, fitting python scripts etc). For example, to perform bias studies
setup in CMSSW_10_2_13 the master branch and copy there the Bias_Studies/ folder.

Instructions:
-------------

1) Environment setup:
    cmsrel CMSSW_13_0_16
    cd CMSSW_13_0_16/src/ 
    cmsenv	   

2) Download the code:
    git clone -b PairedDijetAnalysis https://github.com/CMSDIJET/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer.git CMSDIJET/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer

3) Compile:
    cd CMSSW_13_0_16/src/ 
    scram b -j 8
    
    This gives no errors. If, however, you want to setup the master branch in eg CMSSW_10_2_13
    this will give errors, but you can ignore them since the compiling with "make" to run the
    reduced trees works fine. 

3) Go inside:
    cd CMSDIJET/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer
