git clone -b Ratio_Method https://github.com/dimkarasav/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer.git CMSDIJET/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer

cd CMSDIJET/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer



In the directory C_scripts you can find the scripts to create the Ratio method inputs as well as the Data vs prediction plot.


The inputs to these scripts are the so called "small trees" which have the same format as the reduced trees but only save the events that pass our selection criteria.
In principle these codes could run with reduced trees as inputs with minor modifications.
The MC small trees additionally contain the weight information as an extra variable with respect to the reduced trees.


1) Make_MC_histos.C

	Input: 
	i) MC small tree (or reduced trees with minor modifications)
	Output:
	ii)  .root with the histograms of the dijet mass in SR, CRmiddle, CRhigh for MC in 1GeV and the standard dijet binning.



2) create_Ratio_Method_inputs.C

	Input: 
	i)Output of step 1.
	ii) small tree for data

	Output: 
	 .root with the histograms of the dijet mass in SR, CRmiddle, CRhigh for MC and data in 1GeV and the standard dijet binning.
	The ratios are also saved. This script requires as input


3) Make_RM_Prediction.C

	Inputs:
	i) Output of step 2.
	ii) small tree for data.

	Output: .root with the histograms of:
		i)   the dijet mass in SR, CRmiddle, CRhigh ffor data in 1GeV and the standard dijet binning.
		ii)  the ratio method prediction in 1GeV and the standard dijet binning
		iii) SR/CRhigh ratios for data and MC
		iv)  CRmiddle/CRhigh ratio for MC
		v)   Double ratio between data and MC for SR/CRhigh
		vi)  Fit of the double ratio

4) Make_Histo_of_Standard_Fit.C

	(This script requires to enter the integral of the data in the SR at line 92 by hand.)
	Inputs:
	i)  .root produced by the BinnedFit.py script (eg DijetFitResults_PFDijet2016.root)

	Outputs: .root with the fit result saved as a histogram (this is only used for plotting purposes in the next step).


5) Plot_RM_vs_data.C

Inputs: 
i) Output of step 3
ii) Output of step 4
iii) 3 Signal templates 

Output: 

i) .png and pdf of RM prediction vs Standard Fit vs Data + pulls. Signal templates are also shown.
