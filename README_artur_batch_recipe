## (These instructions are almost entirely a copy from Juskas recipe)

## in a directory setup for Analyzer, create a list of files to be run over.

# With this cryptic command I write a sorted lists of absolute file paths
lxplus066:...CMSDIJET/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer$ls -1 eos/cms/store/group/phys_exotica/dijet/Dijet13TeVScouting/rootTrees_big/2016/CaloScouting/DiJetNtupleV3.0/v1/sixie/ScoutingCaloCommissioning/DiJetNtuplerV3p0_ToCERN_Data_2016_CaloScouting_Run2016B-v1_v1_v1/160512_134847/0000/*root >> lists/ScoutingData/CaloScoutingCommissioning2016.txt

# The above lists would work just fine with a single analysis job if EOS
# is mounted, but in batch processing the paths have to start with
# 'root://eoscms//eos/cms/store/', so lets search and replace:
# (I don't know if there's a script for this)
sed -i 's/eos\/cms\/store/root:\/\/eoscms\/\/eos\/cms\/store/g' lists/ScoutingData/CaloScoutingCommissioning2016.txt

## Download fresh cert JSON and change the path accordingly in cutfile

# Replace the beginning of the cutfile with path to new JSON. Use your favourite editor.
